## [Strict-Transport-Security](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Strict-Transport-Security)

The HTTP Strict-Transport-Security response header (often abbreviated as HSTS)  lets a web site tell browsers that it should only be accessed using HTTPS, instead of using HTTP.

### Syntax
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Strict-Transport-Security
```
Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=<expire-time>
Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=<expire-time>; includeSubDomains
Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=<expire-time>; preload
```
